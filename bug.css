The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly. For example, nesting `calc()` expressions without proper use of parentheses can cause parsing errors.  Another issue is the incorrect use of units within the calculation, which may prevent the browser from interpreting the calculation correctly.  A common mistake is trying to combine percentages with pixels or other units without understanding the resulting behavior.
